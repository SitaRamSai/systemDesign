## GeoHash

  - Geo hashing is done by dividing the grid into 4 parts and give values 00 01 10 11, then select individual grid (Ex: 00) and divide it again into 4       - parts and continue numbering the values. 
  - Every grid has it's own value which when hased gives us the 64bit representation value. 


## QuadTree

  - Tree format
  - Divies the grid into 4 equal parts and continues to follow the process(recursively) for each part untill a threshold is met. 
  - based on the above algorithm it created a tree of all the parts it divided. 




## Idempotency,  IdempotentKey, UUID (v1, v4, v5)

   - Unique ID 


## Synchronous communication vs Asynchronous communication

  
  
  ### Async
  
    - Kafka messaging queue
     
        - Single message is taken by different services
        
 
 ## Relational Databases
 
  - ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Duarability) is guaranteed. 
  - Best choice for read-heavy sytems.
